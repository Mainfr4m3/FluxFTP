# Changelog

All notable FluxFTP changes are documented here.

## 1.0.56 — 2026-10-02

### Added

- Rush import defaults to AUTH TLS, Auto listings and 4 total / 2 upload / 2 download slots. Site Options shows original Rush skip/prio entries and VISIONARY configuration from `RULES/*.ini`, `options.ini` and `rushopt.ini`; site affils are matched by filename. Priority patterns are applied to queued files; legacy skip flags and VISIONARY rules remain source configuration, not converted filters.
- Site Manager columns support ascending/descending sorting.
- Rush import offers an optional UTF-8 `Site name=password` text file for missing passwords, with per-site match status and validation. Existing-site password updates follow the Replace existing choice.
- Site Rules can discover Visionary's linked `User_Files/RULES` folder or select it manually, and edit its `.txt` documents with backups and protection against overwriting external changes.

### Fixed

- Removed the experimental WinSCP engine from racefix.9 and restored the previous FTP/SSH.NET connection and transfer paths. Saved engine selections are ignored; slot defaults remain 4 total / 2 upload / 2 download.
- Password-file imports can explicitly update passwords on selected existing sites even with Skip existing. The password prompt now uses FluxFTP theme resources.
- Local disk transfers are serialized and progress is throttled before dispatch; local copy I/O runs off the UI thread. FXP remains independently scheduled.
- RACE errors now include FTP server reply text alongside status codes.
- Legacy Rush XML import reads the site's SSL mode instead of inferring it only from the port. Explicit SSL/TLS sites use FluxFTP's AUTH TLS-first connection.
- Import Sections preserves per-site paths when importing a full RushSite XML file, instead of assigning every bookmark to `ioFTPD`. Ambiguous names and paths require review.
- Export mIRC bridge bundles updated DLLs that avoid reading beyond the legacy LOADINFO structure in mIRC 7.52. The same DLLs handle the newer mIRC 7.64+ structure, so no export version selector is needed.

## 1.0.53 — 2026-09-29

### Added

- Built-in IRC/ZNC connection settings, FTP-admin verification and private setup commands.
- Multiple announcement networks/channels, FiSH ECB/CBC support and configurable catch rules.
- `!news` shows the latest published FluxFTP release; `!announces` shows caught site announcements.
- Authenticated `POST /irc/connect` saves IRC/ZNC settings and starts the connection without opening Global Settings.
- RACE-Log toolbar window records announcements and transfer events, rotating after 24 hours into the `logs` subfolder.
- JSON site rules in `Rules/_site`, IRC setup examples and a site-rule viewer.
- Bookmark CAPTION import, section import and transfer completion diagnostics included in the desktop build.

### Fixed

- Saved site fields remain readable in INI files. Manually entered FTP/proxy passwords are protected on load.
- Global Settings writes changes before closing; validation and save errors remain visible.
- RACE-Log follows the application theme.
- IRC diagnostics distinguish registration failures, nickname conflicts and channel join failures.

### Notes

- IRC has an explicit option to accept invalid/self-signed certificates, enabled by default; previously saved choices are retained.
- Automatic racing from IRC announcements is not implemented. Catch rules record news and log events.
- Full slftp command compatibility is not implemented; see `docs/slftp-compatibility.md`.

## 1.0.52 — 2026-09-17

### Added

- Manual and API-driven `SITE PRE` commands now classify server replies as success, dupe or failure.
- The `/raw` API exposes duplicate PRE results separately while retaining them in `successes` for compatibility with existing RaceTrade and IRC integrations.

### Fixed

- Starting very large transfer queues now schedules work in a single batch instead of rewriting the complete queue file for every item.
- RaceTrade/API FXP and download jobs now use the same batch scheduler, preventing large races from making the interface appear frozen before transfers begin.
- Queue status synchronization now uses indexed lookups and batch resume operations, avoiding quadratic processing with thousands of files.

## 1.0.51 — 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added a Commander-inspired LOCAL toolbar to both panes.
- The selected local drive is shown as a single highlighted button with volume name, free space and total size in its tooltip.
- Added quick LOCAL actions for creating folders, renaming, deleting and refreshing.

### Changed

- Local drive switching remains in the existing drive list, avoiding duplicate buttons for every available drive.
- The LOCAL toolbar is hidden automatically whenever a pane is switched to Remote mode.

## 1.0.50 — 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- FTP servers advertising RFC 2640 UTF-8 now receive pathname commands using UTF-8 after `OPTS UTF8 ON` negotiation.
- Legacy servers such as ioFTPD that do not advertise UTF-8 now use Windows-1252 control-channel compatibility instead of replacing typographic characters with `?`.
- Downloads, uploads and FXP transfers now preserve filenames containing typographic apostrophes and other non-ASCII characters supported by the server encoding.

## 1.0.49 — 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- Priority List ranks are now carried into the transfer engine, so prioritized file patterns are selected before scoreboard size scoring.
- Files within the same priority rank now retain queue order and use natural numeric name ordering, preventing file 8 from starting before file 2.
- Normal FTP, FXP, downloads, uploads and local transfers now share the same deterministic priority scheduling.

## 1.0.48 — 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added an `ioFTPD / IRC` command preset for sending `SITE IRC`.

### Changed

- Moved `Raw command` to the first position and made it the default selection in Server Commands.
- Commands discovered through `SITE HELP` are appended after the built-in presets.

## 1.0.47 — 2026-08-11

### Added

- Added batch PRE for multiple selected release folders, executed sequentially with one section selection.
- Added sortable Size columns in both panes and sorting for every Transfer Queue column.
- Added protection against accidentally PREing the section directory itself.

### Fixed

- Selected Name, Size or Modified sorting and its direction now persist while navigating between local or remote directories.
- Size and modification sorting now use numeric byte counts and actual timestamps instead of formatted display text.
- ioFTPD delayed CWD event replies such as `This looks like a PRE` no longer desynchronize subsequent FXP commands.
- SITE PRE commands now allow up to ten minutes for large releases while ordinary commands retain their shorter timeout.

## 1.0.46 — 2026-08-09

### Removed

- Removed the legacy cbftp UDP command listener. Automation now uses the authenticated HTTPS/JSON API exclusively.

## 1.0.45 — 2026-08-09

### Added

- Added a Bookmarks window for each Local or Remote pane with site-specific filtering, editing, importing and direct navigation.
- FTPRush imports now include bookmarks from both current JSON configurations and legacy `RushSite.xml` files using `CAPTION` and `REMOTE` attributes.
- Added live DrFTPD FXP speed monitoring through the server's standard `SITE WHO` output.

### Fixed

- Standard EPSV replies now use the selected site or bouncer address instead of treating a complete multi-address field as one invalid FXP address.
- EPSV data connections through SOCKS5 no longer mistake the proxy endpoint for the FTP server's passive-data address.
- Secure glFTPD-to-glFTPD FXP can now complete through SSCN/EPSV when the passive reply only contains a port.

## 1.0.44 — 2026-08-09

### Added

- Added a Themes tab to Global Settings with configurable interface colors, UI and monospace fonts, and font size.
- Added live theme preview, default reset, and JSON theme import/export using `.flux-theme.json` files.
- Added a Changelog button and an integrated release-history window.
- Added a bundled OpenSSL compatibility backend for FTPS servers that cannot negotiate successfully with Windows Schannel.
- Added a per-site option to use the OpenSSL TLS backend directly for glFTPD compatibility.

### Fixed

- Added automatic TLS fallback from Schannel TLS 1.2/1.3 to Schannel TLS 1.2 and then OpenSSL while keeping TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled.
- Self-signed glFTPD and DrFTPD certificates can now be accepted through the existing per-site `Trust invalid TLS certificate` setting.
- DrFTPD FTPS login now authenticates with `USER/PASS` before sending `PBSZ` and `PROT`, matching servers that reject data-protection commands before login.
- Servers that reject `PROT P` can continue with an encrypted control channel and a clear `PROT C` data channel.
- Failed TLS handshakes and certificate validation no longer leave plaintext control streams available to send an invalid unencrypted `QUIT` command.

## 1.0.43 — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Regular FTPS, FTP and SFTP transfers now report live throughput in Metrics, Transfer Jobs and the main status bar.
- Local file copies now use the same live throughput measurement as client-mediated transfers.

## 1.0.42 — 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added optional FluxTelemetry support for live ioFTPD FXP progress, speed and transferred-byte monitoring through a shared loopback JSON API.
- Added the standalone FluxTelemetry bridge with `/info`, `/health`, `/activity`, `/metrics` and Server-Sent Events endpoints.
- Added the lightweight ioFTPD `SITE FLUXWHO` Tcl command based directly on `client who`.
- Added automatic migration from the legacy local ioGUI `sites.ini` when FluxTelemetry has no configured credentials, followed by Windows DPAPI password protection.

### Changed

- FXP monitoring now prefers FluxTelemetry without consuming one monitoring FTP slot per transfer.
- Existing `SITE ioGuiExt who` and `SIZE` monitoring remain available automatically as fallback for ioFTPD and other FTP server configurations.
- FluxTelemetry filters its own polling session, normalizes decimal ioFTPD speeds to bytes per second and suppresses routine HTTP request logging.

## 1.0.41 — 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Passive client-relay connections now skip `EPSV` when the server does not advertise EPSV support and use `PASV` directly.
- Direct secure FXP now drains delayed `200 SSCN:SERVER METHOD` acknowledgements before evaluating the STOR/RETR response.
- FXP servers that omit the preliminary `125/150` reply and respond directly with `226/250` after transferring data are now recognized as successful.
- Completed direct FXP transfers are no longer incorrectly marked failed and retried through client relay because of a delayed SSCN response.

## 1.0.40 — 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added `Start queue` and `Stop queue` controls for manually starting or pausing the complete transfer queue.
- Added separate `Pause selected` and `Resume selected` controls for individual jobs.
- Added queued Local-to-Local file and recursive folder copies with progress reporting.

### Changed

- `Add to queue` now collects files and complete folders without starting them; `Transfer now` continues to begin immediately.
- Stopping the queue pauses waiting jobs and safely cancels active jobs into a resumable paused state.
- Worker slots are warmed only when queued transfers are actually started.

## 1.0.39 — 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added single-instance protection so starting FluxFTP again restores the existing window instead of launching another process.

### Fixed

- Minimizing FluxFTP to the system tray now hides the active window from the Windows taskbar after the minimize transition has completed.
- Restoring FluxFTP from the tray now reliably brings the existing window to the foreground and gives it focus.

## 1.0.38 — 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added RushFTP-style Back, Forward, Up and Refresh navigation controls to both file panes.
- Replaced the plain path fields with editable path-history dropdowns for fast navigation in both Local and Remote mode.
- Local path dropdowns now include available drives, Desktop, Documents, Downloads and up to 20 recently visited folders.

### Changed

- Navigation history is maintained independently for the left and right panes and safely reset when switching between Local and Remote mode.

## 1.0.37 — 2026-08-05

### Added

- Added per-site proxy settings under Site Manager with `Use global proxy`, explicit `No proxy`, SOCKS5, SOCKS4 and HTTP CONNECT modes.
- Per-site proxy settings include host, port, credentials, proxy-side DNS resolution and optional proxying of passive FTP data connections.

### Changed

- Existing sites inherit Global Settings by default, while an explicit per-site proxy or direct-connection override takes precedence for browsing, transfers, worker slots, API jobs and reconnects.
- Per-site proxy passwords are stored in `FluxFTP-sites.ini` using Windows DPAPI protection for the current user.

## 1.0.36 — 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Dark scrollbar tracks now bind correctly to the current value, maximum and viewport size, so dragging the thumb updates the list position accurately.
- Vertical scrollbars now use the full available height instead of being incorrectly constrained to 13 pixels; horizontal scrollbars retain a compact 13-pixel height.

## 1.0.35 — 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added a dark internal file viewer for local and remote files with automatic encoding detection, selectable UTF-8, Windows-1252, IBM437/DOS, ISO-8859-1, ASCII and UTF-16 encodings, plus optional word wrapping.
- Added a separate `Open externally` action that downloads remote files to the preview cache and opens them through their Windows file association.
- NFO files that are not valid UTF-8 now automatically use IBM437 so classic scene artwork is rendered correctly.

### Changed

- Reworked context menus to remove the standard white WPF icon gutter, prevent clipped labels and match the dark FluxFTP interface.
- Added dark themed horizontal and vertical scrollbars throughout the desktop client.

## 1.0.34 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- Connection Log now reports the negotiated TLS version, cipher suite and strength, certificate subject, issuer, validity period and validation result for the control connection and first protected data connection.

### Fixed

- Explicit and implicit FTPS now automatically reconnect with TLS 1.2 only when the initial TLS 1.2/1.3 negotiation returns an invalid or corrupted TLS frame, improving compatibility with affected glFTPd, OpenSSL and bouncer configurations.

## 1.0.33 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- Explicit FTPS now falls back from `AUTH TLS` to the legacy `AUTH SSL` command for compatible older FTP daemons while retaining TLS 1.2/1.3 SChannel encryption.

## 1.0.32 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Secure FXP now falls back from an unsupported CEPR/EPSV command to CPSV when available, preserving the working ioFTPD TLS route before trying PASV/SSCN.
- Clear reverse FXP now falls back from an unsupported EPSV command to regular PASV instead of abandoning the direct route immediately.
- Dragging from an existing multi-selection now preserves every selected file and folder, allowing several remote folders to be queued through one drag-and-drop operation.

## 1.0.31 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- Added local drive selectors to both panes in Local mode for direct navigation between available Windows drives.
- Added drag-and-drop copying between two Local panes, including multiple files and recursive folders.
- Added Windows Explorer drag-and-drop into Local panes for copying and into Remote panes for queued uploads.

### Fixed

- Local directory views now list the complete directory instead of stopping after 100 entries.
- Drive-only paths such as `D:` now resolve to the drive root (`D:\`) consistently.
- Local directory entries remain sorted with folders before files after changing drives.

## 1.0.30 — 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Repositioned transfer progress, elapsed time, remaining time and queue duration at the right edge of the bottom status bar with responsive sizing for smaller windows.
- Transfer Queue columns now adapt to the available width so job state, paths and progress remain visible.
- Scrolling legend mode now uses the full width of the bottom bar instead of being limited to the left status field.

## 1.0.29 — 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Reworked the bottom transfer status into a FlashFXP-inspired FluxFTP bar with direction and filename, transferred bytes and speed, percentage, elapsed time, estimated remaining time and queue duration.

## 1.0.28 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- Desktop SFTP connections with password authentication, browsing, upload, download, resume and client-relay transfers.
- SHA256 SSH host-key verification with an explicit trust prompt and persistent per-site fingerprints.
- SFTP-backed create folder/file, rename, recursive delete, chmod, preview and queue operations.

### Changed

- Remote-to-remote transfers involving SFTP automatically use client relay because the FTP FXP protocol is not available over SSH.

## 1.0.27 — 2026-08-03

### Added

- Expanded both file-list context menus with Open/View, add-to-queue wording, create-and-enter folder, create-empty-file, and copy FTP/file URL actions.
- Expanded the connection log with timestamped raw FTP commands/server replies, automatic password masking, and Copy/Clear controls.

### Fixed

- UNIX symbolic links displayed as `name -> target` are now parsed with separate name and target metadata and can be navigated like directories.

## 1.0.26 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- FXP monitoring now accepts the same ioGuiExt activity rows as ioGUI3 instead of incorrectly discarding active status rows.
- A successful ioGuiExt command without an exact destination filename match no longer disables all fallback progress measurement.
- FluxFTP can read RETR activity from the source site when the destination does not expose matching STOR activity, such as ProFTPD-to-ioFTPD routes.
- The aggregate status progress bar estimates transferred bytes from live FXP speed when ioFTPD does not publish a usable `TRANSFERSIZE` value.

### Changed

- The main status bar now displays live FXP throughput next to the aggregate percentage.

## 1.0.25 — 2026-07-30

### Changed

- Multi-file transfers prewarm the required source/download and destination/upload workers in parallel before queue execution begins.
- Recently returned workers are reused immediately; `NOOP` health checks are now reserved for workers that have been idle for at least 30 seconds.
- Worker prewarming respects each site's login and directional upload/download slot limits and reports its preparation time in the connection log.
- Site Options now includes a cbftp-compatible `Broken PASV` checkbox that selects the site's PORT/active role immediately, without waiting for an initial `425` timeout; the setting is also exposed as `broken_pasv` through the API.

## 1.0.24 — 2026-07-30

### Added

- Learned reverse PASV/PORT routes are persisted per source/destination site pair and restored after FluxFTP restarts.
- Compact FXP phase timings now show CWD, PRET, PROT, PASV/EPSV/CPSV, PORT, SSCN, STOR/RETR acceptance and data-transfer duration.

### Changed

- Independent control commands on the source and destination sessions are issued concurrently where protocol ordering permits.
- A persisted reverse route is removed automatically when it later fails with a timeout or FTP `425`.

## 1.0.23 — 2026-07-30

### Changed

- Successful transfer sessions are retained as reusable site workers instead of logging out after every file.
- Reused workers are health-checked with `NOOP`; disconnected, failed, cancelled or stale-profile sessions are discarded safely.
- Idle worker pools are closed when a site disconnects, its profile changes or FluxFTP exits.

## 1.0.22 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Remote file transfers now change to the source and destination parent directories before issuing relative `RETR` and `STOR` commands, matching FlashFXP behavior and ioFTPD pre-command script expectations.
- The relative-path command flow is used consistently for direct FXP, reversed PASV/PORT FXP, client relay, downloads and uploads.
- FXP failure diagnostics now display the actual `CWD`, relative `RETR` and relative `STOR` command sequence.

## 1.0.21 — 2026-07-29

### Added

- Failed direct FXP attempts now log the source and destination sites, actual connected endpoints, full `RETR` and `STOR` paths, destination parent, data protection, selected route and PRET state.
- Transfer diagnostics deliberately exclude usernames, passwords and authentication commands.

## 1.0.20 — 2026-07-29

### Added

- Optional Advanced Skiplist rules with wildcard or regex matching, File/Directory/Both selection, Allow/Deny actions, scope and ordered first-match evaluation.
- A filled aggregate progress bar in the main status area.

### Changed

- The default main-window size is reduced to fit smaller laptop displays while saved window layouts continue to be restored.
- About now reflects the current FTP, FTPS, FXP, automation, import and ioFTPD feature set.
- The application icon now uses a text-free modern server-and-gear symbol that remains clear at small Windows icon sizes.

### Fixed

- The Close button in the modeless Server Commands window now closes the window correctly.

## 1.0.19 — 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Self-contained Windows releases once again include the native WPF libraries required before the main window can open.
- `SITE PRE` now runs from the selected release's parent directory, matching ioFTPD's expected working directory.
- Delayed ioFTPD CWD-script replies are skipped so the actual PRE result is displayed and the control channel remains synchronized.
- IRC formatting and other invisible control characters are removed from commands before they are sent.
- PRE script variables now use the release named in the command and its resolved release path.

## 1.0.18 — 2026-07-29

### Added

- Per-site FXP data role selection: Auto, PASV or PORT.
- The selected FXP data role is persisted in `FluxFTP-sites.ini` and exposed through the API as `fxp_data_role`.

### Fixed

- Clear FXP can retry with the reverse PASV/PORT topology when the standard route times out.
- A successful reverse route is remembered for the remaining queued files, avoiding repeated timeout delays.
- FXP starts RETR and STOR together for compatibility with servers that wait for the peer before sending a preliminary reply.

## 1.0.17 — 2026-07-28

### Added

- Clearly visible drag handles for independently resizing Transfer Queue and Connection Log.
- Resized queue and log heights continue to be restored on the next start.

### Fixed

- Auto FXP now uses clear PASV/PORT transfers when either site explicitly uses plain FTP, while two FTPS sites remain secure by default.
- Unix `LIST` summary rows such as `total 10690` are no longer mistaken for files and queued for transfer.
- Window layout persistence now rejects invalid non-finite dimensions instead of failing while the application closes.

## 1.0.16 — 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Opening the embedded transfer queue no longer crashes while jobs are active.
- The Transfer Jobs progress bars now use the same safe one-way progress binding.

## 1.0.15 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- Multi-selection with Ctrl/Shift in both file panes for batching files and folders.
- Recursive local-folder uploads, matching the existing recursive download and FXP folder handling.
- Multi-item support for Transfer, Queue, drag-and-drop and context-menu transfers.

## 1.0.14 — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Transfer slots now reload the latest Site Manager profile before every file, so switching a connected FTP/FTPS site from Auto to Clear FXP takes effect without reconnecting.
- Clarified that Clear mode supports fully plain FTP control connections and PASV/PORT FXP without data TLS.

## 1.0.13 — 2026-07-26

### Added

- RaceTrade-compatible REST spreadjob endpoints for starting and monitoring races.
- RaceTrade/cbftp aliases for site settings including PRET, CEPR, XDUPE, binary mode and named priorities.
- Spreadjob tracking tied to the underlying FluxFTP FXP queue.
- Automatic probing of eligible race sites to locate the announced release source.

### Changed

- The `/sites` and `/sections` collection endpoints now return cbftp-compatible name arrays; their detail endpoints continue to expose full configuration objects.

## 1.0.12 — 2026-07-26

### Added

- FTPRush import guide with separate **Import Sites** and **Import Bookmarks** choices.
- Mutually exclusive **Replace existing** and **Skip existing** conflict handling.
- Import of global bookmarks from `core_setting.json` and per-site bookmarks from `site.json`.
- Persistent `FluxFTP-bookmarks.json` storage.
- Bookmark selectors in both panes for local and site-specific remote navigation.
- Explicit **Kill ghost login (/username)** option in Connection details for ioFTPD accounts.

### Fixed

- Local downloads now close and flush the `.ioftp-part` stream before the final rename, preventing Windows file-lock failures.

## 1.0.11 — 2026-07-26

### Added

- Automatic nuke detection for common ioFTPD/glFTPD directory and marker-file names.
- A Status column and red highlighting for nuked entries in both file panes.
- Nuke status fields in the `/path` API response.
- A manual warning and override before transferring a nuked remote folder.
- Safe blocking of nuked releases before API/d-tool FXP or download jobs are queued.
- Per-site direct FXP protection mode: Auto keeps TLS mandatory, while Clear explicitly permits PASV/PORT FXP without data-channel TLS.
- `fxp_protection` support in the sites API for DrFTPD and other compatibility workflows.
- Fixed an application crash when DrFTPD returns `550` while a remote directory is queued recursively; inaccessible subfolders are now logged and skipped.

## 1.0.10 — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Per-section release validation (Wanker check) with Disabled, Warning and Block modes.
- Allow and deny rules using wildcards or `regex:` patterns.
- Interactive precheck testing in the Sections window.
- Validation before manual `SITE PRE`, raw API PRE and section-based API/d-tool race or FXP jobs.
- Clear precheck logging and manual override for Warning mode.

## 1.0.9 — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Reusable Spread presets that remember section, source site and target sites.
- Apply, save, update and delete controls for presets in the Spread Jobs window.
- Optional unique site descriptions in Connection details and Site Manager.
- `description` in the cbftp-compatible sites API.
- API and UDP downloads can resolve a site by either name or description.

## 1.0.8 — 2026-07-23

### Added

- Per-site **Affiliates (affils)** field in Site Options.
- cbftp-compatible `affils` synchronization through the sites API for d-tool.

### Fixed

- Preserve affiliate values when Site Options are edited and saved.

## 1.0.7 — 2026-07-23

### Added

- cbftp-compatible UDP listener for d-tool `raw`, `fxp`, `race` and `download` commands.
- Headless API and UDP transfers using saved sites and reusable transfer slots.
- cbftp-compatible `/spreadjobs` endpoint.
- Additional site API fields for sections, transfer policies, affiliates and binary mode.
- Support for both standard and compact cbftp FXP command formats.

### Fixed

- Match cbftp's `/raw` response structure and connection behavior for d-tool.
- Remove ANSI color codes from raw FTP command responses.
- Add safe API request diagnostics without logging credentials.
