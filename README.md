See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

FluxFTP is a modern dual-pane FTP/FXP client prototype.

FluxFTP supports FTP/FTPS connections, dual remote sessions, resumable transfers,
and secure FXP with automatic client-relay fallback.

Per-site affiliate/group names can be edited in Site Options and are exposed as
`affils` through the cbftp-compatible API for automatic d-tool synchronization.
Spread Jobs also supports reusable presets for section, source and target routes.
Optional unique site descriptions are exposed through the sites API and can be
used in API or d-tool download commands instead of the technical site name.
Sections can enforce release-name prechecks with wildcard or `regex:` allow and
deny rules. Warning mode allows a manual override, while Block mode prevents PRE
and section-based API/d-tool race or FXP jobs.
Common ioFTPD/glFTPD nuke directory names and marker files are detected
automatically. Nuked entries are highlighted in both panes, manual transfers
require confirmation, and unattended API/d-tool transfers are blocked before
any files are queued. The `/path` API exposes `nuked` and `nuke_reason`.
Direct FXP protection is configurable per site. The default **Auto** mode always
requires TLS-protected server-to-server data through CPSV/SSCN. **Clear** must be
selected explicitly for a site before FluxFTP will use unencrypted PASV/PORT FXP;
the FTPS control logins remain encrypted.
Clear also supports fully plain `None (FTP)` sites with no TLS on either the
control or FXP data connection. Updated Site Options are reloaded for each new
transfer slot, so changing Auto to Clear does not require reconnecting the panes.
The FTPRush import guide can import sites and bookmarks independently, with
Replace or Skip handling for existing entries. Global local bookmarks and
site-specific remote bookmarks are available from selectors in both panes.
ioFTPD users can enable **Kill ghost login** in Connection details, which sends
the login as `/username` while keeping the saved account and password workflow.

Transfer Queue and Transfer Jobs provide graphical per-file progress bars, queued
and started timestamps, live speed information, and an aggregate activity bar in
the main status area. FluxFTP can also check GitHub Releases for updates at startup
or manually from Global Settings.

Remote folders can be downloaded recursively to either Local pane. FluxFTP creates
the local directory tree and queues each file through the configured reusable
download slots while applying the Skiplist and Priority List.

FluxFTP can minimize and close to the Windows system tray so transfers and API
automation continue in the background. Use **Exit FluxFTP** from the tray menu to
stop the application; an additional warning is shown while the HTTPS/JSON API is active.

### mIRC and automation

HTTPS/JSON API jobs use saved site profiles and reusable slots and do not require
the sites to be open in the two visible Remote panes. Keep **Localhost only**
enabled when mIRC and FluxFTP run on the same computer.

d-tool's current line-oriented `/raw` parser also prints standalone JSON
delimiters. The compatible parser fix is available in
[scriptzteam/d-tool#1](https://github.com/scriptzteam/d-tool/pull/1).

Standalone mIRC/AdiIRC control scripts and the VISIONARY bridge are included in [extras/irc](extras/irc/README.md). VISIONARY preserves explicit source/target chains through a current-user-only Windows named pipe.

### Global Settings

![FluxFTP Global Settings](docs/screenshots/global-settings.png)

Saved sites may contain multiple addresses or FTP bouncers in the **Address(es)** field, separated by spaces. FluxFTP tries the first address immediately and starts the remaining attempts after one second. The first successful address is promoted to the front of the saved list for future connections.

Site Manager can import saved sites from FTPRush 3 `site.json`, legacy FTPRush
`RushSite.xml`, and FlashFXP `Sites.ftp` XML exports. A preview lets you select
profiles and leaves detected duplicates unchecked. Imported passwords are saved
using the same Windows DPAPI protection as manually created FluxFTP profiles.

## Currently supported FTP commands

FluxFTP sends the following commands automatically when required by browsing, transfers and connection setup:

- Connection and TLS: `USER`, `PASS`, `AUTH TLS`, `PBSZ`, `PROT`, `FEAT`, `TYPE` and `QUIT`
- Navigation and file management: `CWD`, `MKD`, `RMD`, `DELE`, `RNFR`, `RNTO` and `SITE CHMOD`
- Directory and file information: automatic `MLSD` → `LIST` → `STAT -l` fallback, plus `SIZE`
- Data connections and resume: `EPSV`, CEPR address replies, `PASV`, `PORT`, `EPRT` and `REST`
- File transfers: `RETR` and `STOR`
- Secure server-to-server FXP: `CPSV`, `SSCN ON` and `SSCN OFF`
- Distributed FTP servers: `PRET LIST`, `PRET RETR` and `PRET STOR` when **Needs PRET** is enabled for a site
- Multi-file duplicate handling: `SITE XDUPE 3` and X-DUPE `553` reply processing when **Use XDUPE** is enabled

The Commands window currently includes presets for:

- Common ioFTPD/glFTPD commands including `SITE TAGLINE`, `SITE NFO`, `SITE WHO`, `SITE RULES`, `SITE SEARCH`, `SITE NUKES`, `SITE NEW` and `SITE HELP`
- ioFTPD commands including `SITE PRE` and `SITE REQUESTS`
- glFTPD file, group, user, log, statistics and miscellaneous administration commands
- Optional pzs-ng and custom glFTPD commands, clearly identified in the preset name
- `SITE ioGuiExt who` is used internally for ioFTPD FXP speed monitoring

**Load SITE HELP** can add commands advertised by the connected server. FTPRush `RushCmd.xml` command packs can also be imported. The raw-command field accepts one FTP command at a time; credential commands `USER`, `PASS` and `ACCT` are blocked there to avoid exposing or replacing the active login.

## Project boundaries

- `IoFtp.Core`: protocol-neutral connection, browsing and transfer contracts.
- `IoFtp.Desktop`: Windows desktop shell and theme resources.
- `docs`: product scope and architecture decisions.

## Initial milestones

1. Usable dual-pane shell and ioGUI3 theme foundation.
2. Persistent queue and resumable local copy reference implementation.
3. FTP/FTPS transport with capability detection.
4. Server-to-server FXP orchestration.
5. Site profiles and cbftpd-aware commands.
6. SFTP transport as an optional provider.
